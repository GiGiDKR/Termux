## üíª Running Windows programs on Termux native (XFCE Desktop + Mobox): <a name=mobox-with-desktop></a> 
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> All this process is explaining in the folowing [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfCKHWUwAr0). I highly recommend looking at it first 


First of all you need to install Mobox (follow instructions from the official repository): https://github.com/olegos2/mobox

1. Configure your Termux native desktop. I recommend following the process described in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq85dxMb7e4).

2. Download the following script into the `Download` folder. Thanks to the user `@Feer_C9` on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/termux/comments/1bkzpzz/comment/kwwwxni/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) for this script

* mobox_run.sh: 
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LinuxDroidMaster/Termux-Desktops/main/scripts/termux_native/mobox_run.sh
```

3. Give script execution permissions:
```
chmod +x mobox_run.sh
```

4. Now you can run Wine explorer (from Mobox with all the configurations applied) with the following command: `./mobox_run.sh explorer` but I recommend creating a desktop shortcut. You can download the shortcut direclty into the `Desktop` folder with this command: 

* MoboxExplorer.desktop: 
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LinuxDroidMaster/Termux-Desktops/main/scripts/termux_native/MoboxExplorer.desktop
```
Now you can double click the shortcut in the Termux Desktop (for example XFCE4) and open Mobox explorer to run Windows programs or games.

 ```
# Tip:  /usr is at the same level as /home
/usr/share/fonts
